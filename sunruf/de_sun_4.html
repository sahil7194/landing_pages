bills or it’s just a Rich people thing, it’s not like that it is very much
affordable to all. Once you install a solar panel or solar system for your

affordable. Still you are thinking that your budget or solar system is out of
your reach. They are options like finance & Govt. Subsidies are available.
You can take advantage of it.

                                                <p>When you are installing solar in your house you would want to know how big of a solar system do you really need. The answer to that depends on how much energy will your appliances use over a period of time.</p>
<p>The power consumption of appliances is generally given in Watts, e.g. an FL tube light consumes around 40 Watts power (this information can be found on the data sticker that most electrical items have). To calculate the energy you will use over time, just multiply the power consumption by the hours of intended use. The 40W tube light in this example, on for 4 hours, will take 40×4=160 Watthour (Wh), further if you have 2 such lights required to run for 4 and 3 hours respectively, the total energy consumption will be
</p>
<p>(40×4 = 160) + (40×3 = 120) = 280Wh</p>

<p>Repeat this for all the appliances you wish to use, and then add the results to establish total energy consumption.
</p>
<p>Let’s say that your electricity consumption is of 1500Wh. It is recommended that the size of your solar array should be at least 35% of daily energy consumption, preferably 40%. In this case, you should go for a solar panel of 1500×40%= 600Wp.

It is recommended that the size of the inverter in the off-grid installation should be at least 40% more than the total power of solar panels.

The size of the battery depends on the energy usage during backup time that you would draw from the batteries. Battery capacity should be at least 160% of the energy consumption. Let’s say that your total load is 1500Wh.
</p>
 <p>So you need minimum of 1500×160% = 2400 Wh capacity. Means 12V/200Ah or 24V/100Ah battery.
</p>
 <p>It is advised to select the capacity of battery approximately 1.25 times of the above calculation for reliable operation.

 <p>In the above-mentioned example, you can use 2nos. 12V/120Ah batteries.</p>

Going solar really helps people who usually get very high electricity bills because they get to make their own electricity for free. Let’s say that you have a 5kW system, then it will generate 20 units of electricity per day – 600 per month – 7200 per year. If 1 unit of electricity costs Rs. 9 then it would cost Rs. 64,800. You would make Rs. 64,800 worth of electricity through solar – this is your savings.</p>

You can check more details about solar subsidy on the official website of MNRE of India. However, in reality, very few people are able to avail of subsidy because it requires too much paperwork and too much time. Our advice would be to forget about subsidies and select a solar system that gives you a good ROI. We have seen that some people recover the cost of installation in just 5 years!</p>

<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Monocrystalline Solar Panels -
These are the oldest types of Solar panels & the most developed ones.
These monocrystalline Solar Panels are made of 40 solar
monocrystalline cells. These are square shaped cells. They are made
up of silicon. When you see it you find it black as sunlight reacts with
the pure silicon.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Polycrystalline Solar Panels -
These solar panels are newer in development but due to popularity &
efficiency they are rising quickly. They are also made up of silicon,
same as monocrystalline solar panels but the difference is that they
are made up of fragments of silicon crystals melted together. You find
them blue as the sunlight reacts with them. They are also square in
shape but without gaps.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Thin-Film Solar Panels -
An extremely new development of solar panels. They are not always
made up of silicon, other materials like Cadmium Telluride, Amorphous
Silicon, Copper Indium Gallium Selenide also can be used to make
these solar panels. These panels are created by placing main material
between thin sheets conducting material & with the glass layer on the
top of it for protection.</p>
