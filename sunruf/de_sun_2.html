Disclaimer
Net-metering is a utility billing process that is available in most of the Indian states which offer
residential & commercial customers who make the extra electricity by using their solar panels. It
means that this net-metering is an individual authority of the electric board of your state. There
are some minor steps between you & Discom which you need to follow. SunRuf helps you out to
cross these steps & takes regular follow up with the responsible authorities on your behalf. This
thing ensures that you are receiving the benefits of your solar plane installation.
Although SunRuf helps you with the Net-metering process, we are not responsible for any kind
of delay as it is completely a Government Process.</p>
